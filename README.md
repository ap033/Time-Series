Build a Model to forecast the demand (passenger traffic) in Airplanes. The data is classified in data time and the passengers travelling per month. We have a problem statement with in a line which has
the data of passengers across months so here what we need to do we need to build a forecast to determine how many number of passengers are going to abort these Airlines at the month level in the
future.
So here we have month or you can say dates so here we have dates from 1949 till 1960 and we have the number of passengers traveling per month so now we have this kind of data and we need to analyze
what will be the number of passengers if you have to predict it for next 10 years.
